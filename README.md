As a researcher in neuroinformatics, I manage bio-data analysis pipelines on a daily basis, developing ML pipelines (Clustering, classification, regression, etc) and tools used as second opinion systems for MDs. I daily use Python (scikit-learn, SHAP, pandas, NumPy, Scipy, etc.) for the development of ML and data analysis pipelines, Bash scripting (Linux environment), R, Matlab, Wordpress, Git-Hub for development of web portal aimed to: (i) help scientists do high-throughput  research, (ii) provide clinical professionals automated diagnostic biomarkers of diseases for single case analysis and individual patient characterization, (iii) provide secure data storage and data archiving. I daily perform bio-data analysis through different analysis tools (SPM, FSL, Matlab, Python, etc). As a member of the Neuroinformatics Unit at FBF, I manage a server (Linux-based environment) equipped with a High-Performance Computing (HPC) center featuring 500+ CPUs, 4+ TB RAM, 1000+ TB storage, and 8 A100 GPUs with 40 GB each. The computing cluster is managed within a virtual environment and controlled by the Sun Grid Engine scheduler. The HPC is equipped with popular computing environments (Docker, Singularity, Python, R).
